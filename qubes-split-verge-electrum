2. Run the debian-8-cryp template and download the CrypticCoin Electrum wallet

3. Create a new AppVM by running **qvm-create -t debian-8-cryp -l black offline-cryticcoin** and **qvm-prefs -s offline-cryp netvm none** in dom0
4. Run the offline-cryp AppVM and create a new wallet


## Create a watch-only wallet

1. Create a AppVM with the debian-8-cryp template by running **qvm-create -t debian-8-cryp -l green watching-cryp** and **qvm-prefs -s watching-cryp netvm sys-whonix** in dom0
2. Run the watching-cryp AppVM and create a **watch-only** wallet by importing the public keys from the offline-cryp AppVM


### Important
The private keys should **never** leave the offline-cryp AppVM.
If you want to send your CrypticCoin, you should create a new AppVM using the debian-8-cryp template, create a wallet with your existing seeds from the offline wallet.
**Note:** Delete this AppVM after sending your coins.
